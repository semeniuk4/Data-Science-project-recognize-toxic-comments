Recognizing toxic comments using machine learning

## Project Description
This model was created using sklearn and linear regression, MultinomialNB using toxic comments dataset from kaggle.com. This project uses such techniques as text processing, splitting sentences to tokens, identifying and removing stop words, removing punctuation, using TfidfVectorizer. This project uses almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, feature engineering, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, pipelines.
